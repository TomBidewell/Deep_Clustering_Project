Cluster analysis is a cornerstone of machine learning, involving the grouping of unlabelled data and spanning a diverse range of applications from image detection to customer segmentation. The demand for high-quality clusters has led to the integration of deep learning techniques into the clustering algorithm, exemplified by Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC) in 2016. Despite their success, these methods require immense computational resources making them largely impractical for industrial use. This essay demonstrates that scaling down these techniques does not retain their ability to perform high quality clustering and that simpler methods may be more appropriate when working on a smaller scale. Specifically, we propose deltaDEC, a small, quick to train linear adaptation of DEC that uses the nearest cluster Delta Distribution. We present its ability to produce near perfect clustering on real world, industrial scale data for a fraction of the computational cost. Our research could be of significant importance for companies looking to incorporate state-of-the-art clustering techniques into their data analytics without the associated computational cost.
